# KEEBMONKEY IN14 v3 Walnut Nixie Clock

This repository contians a mirror and some basic English instructions for setting the time on the Keebmonkey IN14 Walnut Clock which was sold on Drop.com in 2024. 

The clock does not come with English instructions and it is really not very obvious how to configure the clock and set the time. 

This archive includes some basic English instructions and a mirror of the Acorn Workshop website which contained the software and Chinese instructions for configuring the clock. 

### Clock Information
This clock is the third generation Nixie tube clock I made. Compared with the previous two generations, it supports MP3 high-definition voice, brightness adjustment, and Bluetooth control. The new supporting software is more intuitive and easy to use. It has a built-in new generation of sensor switch parameters with adjustable parameters, built-in gyroscope angle recognition, an ultra-thin body of <10mm, and a more advanced 32-bit MCU.

### Clock Feature List
1. Adopting the former Soviet Union DGM01/IN14 Nixie tube, DGM01 Nixie tube has a longer life and better display effect
2. Bluetooth applet/Android APP is easy to operate, and one-click quick calibration time
3. Built-in new generation induction switch, adjustable sensitivity, more stable performance
4. Built-in gyroscope, can change the backlight and clock switch according to the tilt angle
5. Brightness 10 levels of adjustment, manual automatic adjustment
6. High-quality voice broadcast, you can change the music MP3 by yourself
7. RGB multi-mode color backlight
8. High-precision clock IC, accurate timekeeping
9. Ultra-thin body, solid wood CNC one-piece molded shell
10. Support PC client, can be equipped with PC Bluetooth wireless connection tool
11. Support timer (with countdown) and anniversary date (with countdown days) display

## Setting the Time
There appears to be four main ways to configure the clock: 
1. Connect the clock through USB-C to a Windows PC, install the XGClock Software and configure it using that software.
   - The PC Software Can be found in this archive. 
2. Connect to the Clock using the XG Clock Android Client. This will require an Android device such as phone or tablet.
   - The Android Software (apk) can be found within this archive. Download and install this on your Android Device.
   - Plug the device in for power using USB-C and start the Application.
   - The Android Application should detect the clock using bluetooth and then you can configure the clock.
   - The software can be changed to English using the language select button in the top left corner.  
3. WeChat "XG Clock" applet which requires a WeChat account and application to be installed.
   - You can search for applet within WeChat or scan the QR Code inside this repository. 
4. Some variations of the clock include a remote for setting the time. This clock may support the remote but this has not been tested. 

## Archive Contents 
- Manual: original Chinese manual. 
- PC Client Software: XGClock software used to configure the clock from a Windows Machine (not tested by myself). 
- XG Clock Android: 

## To-do & Future Scope: 
The following list of items would be nice-to-have additions for the future: 
- Fully translated Chinese to English Manual
- More detailed pictures of the clock, including the procedure to change the nixie tubes and internals. 
- Open-source implementation of an application for controlling the clock (Windows/Linux/IOS/Android)
